Languages
+ Python (Django)
+ Ruby (Rails)
+ Node.js (Do we need async?)
+ PHP (No one likes it, but anyone can code it)

Servers
+ Can't really comment. 
+ Jetty works if you're going Java.
+ Apache works if you're going PHP. 

Databases
+ Postgres
+ Cassandra
+ Voldemort
+ Riak

What are we storing, do we want to satisfy arbitrary relationships, or is key/value fine?
I can attest from using Voldemort at work that once you start storing anything mildly complicated, everything sucks.
Are we coding in Java, if not we might want Riak in place of Voldemort, because it has a REST API.

Before we pick this, pick what is going on this website, and what it is suppossed to do.

Other 2 cents:

Repo/Branch Organization Flow
+ Always pull with --rebase
+ Git Flow tends to prevent people from understanding Git
+ Don't bother with a dev branch until after first release

Hosting
+ If you use UMich servers, you get PHP. Otherwise you need your own box.
