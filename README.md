# Michigan Hackers Website

- - -

## Overview
The Michigan Hackers website is intended to be a repository for many things. (Other than code :-D) At this time, we'd like those to be:

+ Basic information about the organization and its mission(s).
+ Information and resources related to upcoming and past events. (Videos/Slides/Memes)
+ Information about our sponsors, affiliations, and other external activities.
+ Some way to feature projects that have been built, in part or in whole, by members. 

For the last point about projects, we've talked internally about a simple "gallery" page. I think however, that we can get a bit more clever with it. 
Perhaps we can come up with a neat way to allow for arbitrary subdomaining. That could lead to some fun reverse proxy configs. (Who needs apache configs :-P)

Feel free to submit pull requests with your comments and contributions. Also be sure to add your name to the list if you commit any code.
