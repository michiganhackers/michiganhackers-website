# Michigan Hackers Website

- - -

## Overview
The Michigan Hackers website is intended to be a repository for many things. (Other than code :-D) At this time, we'd like those to be:

+ Basic information about the organization and its mission(s).
+ Information and resources related to upcoming and past events. (Videos/Slides/Memes)
+ Information about our sponsors, affiliations, and other external activities.
+ Some way to feature projects that have been built, in part or in whole, by members. 

For the last point about projects, we've talked internally about a simple 
"gallery" page. I think however, that we can get a bit more clever with it. 
Perhaps we can come up with a neat way to allow for arbitrary subdomaining. 
That could lead to some fun reverse proxy configs.

We should also decide from the getgo if we want to use a pre-made CMS, or write
our own. Both have their merits; it depends on what we want the website to do
above and beyond the expected functionality. 

Feel free to submit pull requests with your comments and contributions. 
Also be sure to add your name to the list if you commit any code.
